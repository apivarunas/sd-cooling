# Introduction
The `sd-cooling` utility calculates TRM acquisition as a function of
temperature, grain size & shape, field strength and direction. It uses simple 
single domain Stoner-Wohlfarth grains.

# Compilation

## Windows

Anthony Pivarunas, in the year of our lord 2025, managed to compile this on Windows. The utilities used were
CMake ([https://cmake.org](https://cmake.org)) crossplatform make utility (minimum version 3.17).  Additionally
the Boost ([https://boost.org](https://boost.org)) library with `program-options` was compiled and available on 
the build system. I specifically used Boost 1.89.0, and the Windows binary `boost_1_89_0-msvc-14.3-64.exe`. A final
necessity is Visual Studio, with C++ development option.

The tricky things:

1. One has to edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the main downloaded directory and change the line referencing `find_package`, like so:

`find_package(Boost CONFIG REQUIRED)`

2. Once you've Configured and Generated (in the CMake GUI), you open the project in Visual Studio. It will throw errors, specifically
   being unable to find first some boost `.hpp` files and after that is fixed, a boost `.lib` file. How do you fix that, you ask? Well,
   by adding the right file paths.

   For the .hpp files, right-click on "cooling (Visual Studio 2022)" in the "Solution Explorer" then on "C/C++" then "General" and add the boost root folder to the "Additional Include Directories".
   For the .lib file, almost the same process, but go to "Linker" then "General" then add folder with the lib file to "Additional Library Directories".

Voila.

I hope this helps someone else.

## Usage (Windows, AFP)

The code, at least for me, ended up on a `src_cmdline\cooling\Release`folder.

Code did not run with command:

`cooling model_1.json --real-run`

but seemed to exhibit the example with:

`cooling model_1.json`

## Linux/Unix.
This code can be compiled on linux (specifically Ubuntu version 20.04.2 LTS)
using the CMake ([https://cmake.org](https://cmake.org)) crossplatform make
utility (minimum version 3.17).  Additionally this code requires the Boost
([https://boost.org](https://boost.org)) library with `program-options` to be
compiled and available on the build system. The current version of the code has
been compiled with Boost version 1.76.0.

Once the code has been downloaded from the repository, a build directory
should be created somewhere on the system, we subsequently refer to this 
directory as `<build-dir>`. Then in order to compile 
```bash
    $> cd <build-dir>
    $> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <source-dir>
```
where `<source-dir>` is the directory which was acquired from the repository.
The `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` flag is optional, however it produces a code
that should run quicker and if it is not present debugging information will be
sent to `stdout`.

It is possible that CMake encounters a problem finding the Boost libraries, 
in this case it may be useful to set the `-DBOOST_ROOT=<boost-dir>` flag
to point to the root directory of the Boost installation for example
```bash
    $> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBOOST_ROOT=<boost-dir> <source-dir>
```

Once CMake has completed successfully, you can build the executable using
make
```bash
    $> make
```
This command should result in an executable called `cooling` in the
`<build-dir>/src_cmdline/cooling` directory. 

### Installation
By default, CMake generates an installation prefix when executing the `make install` command which attempts to 
install `sd-cooling` to `/usr/local`. This may be changed by setting the CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to an
alternative installation directory
```bash
  $> cmake <args> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<my-installation-prefix> <source-dir>
```
The `sd-cooling` utility may then be installed in the usual way
```bash
  $> make install
```

## OSX
In order to compile on OSX/Apple systems we recommend first installing XCode
([https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/))
along with the command line tools which is available free from Apple and can be
fond in the AppStore.

Next we need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org) and the
[Boost](https://boost.org), which we can do using homebrew
([https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)). Once Homebrew is successfully
installed, we can execute the following commands
```bash
    $> brew install cmake
    $> brew install boost
```

This should set up the system to build `sd-cooling` in the manner described
above.

# Usage
The `cooling` utility can be called from the command line
```bash
    $> cooling model.json --real-run
```
where `model.json` is a file in JSON format (described below) that is the input
for a cooling model and `--real-run` indicates that we actually want to run the
model as opposed to displaying diagnostic information.

## JSON model file format
An input file for the `cooling` utility is a JSON file with the following 
format
```
{
    "material": <choice of "magnetite", "iron">,
    "sizes": <JSON fragment (see below)>,
    "elongations": <JSON fragment (see below)>,
    "directions": <JSON fragment (see below)>,
    "applied_field": {
        "strength": <integer>,
        "direction": [<float>, <float>, <float>],
        "unit": <choice of: "T", "mT", "uT">
    },
    "cooling_regime": {
        "ambient_temperature": <float>,
        "initial_temperature": <float>,
        "reference_time": <float>,
        "temperature_reference_time": <float>,
        "allowable_percentage_drop": <float>,
        "stopping_temperature": 50
    },
    "outputs": {
        "model": <string>,
        "sizes": <optional string>,
        "elongations": <optional string>,
        "directions": <optional string>,
        "cooling_regime": <optional string>
    },
    "tau0": <optional float>,
    "epsilon": <optional float>,
    "n_polish": <optional float>
}
```

### JSON sizes fragment
The sizes fragment should be either a list or a distribution of individual 
sizes. The following fragment specifies a list where each size and the
proportion of grains that make up an assembly of that size are specified
```
{
    "list": [
        {"value": <float>, "fraction": <float>},
        ...
        {"value": <float>, "fraction": <float>}
    ],
    "unit": <choice of "m", "cm", "mm", "um", "nm">
}
```
where `list` denotes a list of sizes followed by a list of one or more
name-value pairs where `value` is the grain size and `fraction` is the
proportion of grains at that size. Internally the values given for `fraction`
are normalized so that they sum to unity.

Alternatively we may specify a lognormal distribution for sizes
```
{
    "distribution": {
        "type": "lognormal",
        "nbins": <integer>,
        "shape": <float>,
        "location": <float>,
        "scale": <float>,
        "start": <float>,
        "end": <float>
    },
    "unit": <choice of "m", "cm", "mm", "um", "nm">
}
```
where `nbins` is the number of grain sizes, `start` is the size range start
value and `end` is the size range value. The other parameters: `shape`,
`location` and `scale`, govern the log normal distribution from which values 
are drawn as shown in the equation

<img src="doc/images/lognormal/lognormal.png" alt="Lognormal" width="70%"/>

### JSON elongations fragment

The elongations fragment looks exactly like the sizes fragment described above
however the `unit` field is no longer needed.

### JSON directions fragment
The direction fragment should either be a list or a selection of directions
drawn from a function. The list fragment is very similar to the list fragments
for sizes and elongations, with the exception that the `value` field is now
a triple of three floating point values as opposed to a scalar and the `unit`
field is not required
```
{
    "list": [
        {"value": [<float>, <float>, <float>], "fraction": <float>},
        ...
        {"value": [<float>, <float>, <float>], "fraction": <float>}
    ]
}
```

Only one direction distribution function is currently supported called
*fibonacci*. This function will uniformly sample the sphere in `nbins`
directions and assign a fraction taken from a uniform distribution to each
grain orientation. The JSON fragment should look like
```
{
    "distribution": {
        "type": "fibonacci",
        "nbins": <int>
    }
}
```

### JSON cooling\_regime fragment
The `cooling_regime` fragment tells us how quickly a sample cools. It follows 
the Newtonian cooling rate equation

<img src="doc/images/newton-cooling/newton-cooling.png" alt="Newton cooling" width="70%"/>

* `ambient_temperature` is identified with T<sub>amb</sub>,
* `initial_temperature` is identified with T<sub>0</sub>,
* `reference_time` is identified with t<sub>1</sub>,
* `temperature_at_reference_time` is identified with T<sub>1</sub>,
* `allowable_percentage_drop` is the maximum allowed drop in temperature
  (as a fraction) for each time step - this quantity governs the time step
  at which we calculate energy barriers.
* `stopping_temperature` is an optional value which is a hard stop to the 
  calculation


### JSON outputs fragment
The `outputs` fragments is a list of files that are written when the 
model has completed execution.

* `model` is the name of the final model file in comma separated file format,
  the fields are: 1) time in seconds, 2) temperature 3)
  cooled normalized remanence 4) equilibrium remanence;
* `sizes` is the name of a file that contains a histogram of the sizes used in
  the model, the fields are: 1) size, 2) fraction;
* `elongations` is the name of a file that contains a histogram of the
  elongations used in the model, the fields are: 1) elongation, 2) fraction;
* `directions` is a file containing each direction and the fraction of grains
  occupying that direction, the fields are: 1) direction x component, 2)
  direction y component, 3) direction z component, 4) fraction;
* `cooling_regime` is a file containing the cooling curve, the fields are 1)
  time in seconds, 2) temperature.

### JSON other fields
The only other fields in a model JSON input are 

* `tau0` which is the magnetic reordering time usually taken to be 1E-9 or 
  1E-10 seconds,
* `epsilon` a value used to check whether floating point quantities in the code
  are sufficiently close to zero (this does not affect multiprecision routines).
* `n_polish` the number of Newton-Raphson polishing steps used when finding 
  roots to the Stoner-Wohlfarth equation (usually zero).

## JSON model file examples

The following two examples show possible uses of the JSON model file format.
The first example illustrates how the user can explicitly supply `sizes`,
`elongations` and `directions` fields with list fragments. The second example
illustrates the use of distributions for `sizes`, `elongations` and
`directions`. Of course it is possible to mix lists and distributions, for
example you can have a distribution of `direcions` and `sizes` and examine
specific elongations using a list.

### Example JSON - explicit lists
```json
{
  "material": "magnetite",

  "sizes": {
    "list": [{"value": 30, "fraction": 1.0}],
    "unit": "nm"
  },

  "elongations": {
    "list": [{"value": 60, "fraction": 1.0}]
  },

  "directions": {
    "list": [{"value": [1,0,0], "fraction": 0.2}]
  },

  "applied_field": {
    "strength": 30,
    "direction": [1,0,0],
    "unit": "uT"
  },

  "cooling_regime": {
    "ambient_temperature": 15.00,
    "initial_temperature": 579.999,

    "allowable_percentage_drop": 0.1,
    "stopping_temperature": 50
  },
